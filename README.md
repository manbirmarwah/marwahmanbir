## ðŸ‘‹ Hello World!

I'm an engineer from India who's passionate about empowering people through technology to achieve more. Currently, I'm working as a Community Manager at ConsenSys for MetaMaskâ€”the industry leading Ethereum software wallet and a gateway to the decentralised web. I've dabbled around with Android Development, Design, Arduino and Open Source back when I was an undergrad. I strongly believe that technology holds the power to advance how we organise and lead the economy, and democratising the internet would be a foundational step towards that.
