## 👋 Hello World!

I'm a 22 year old engineer from India and I'm passionate about empowering people through technology to achieve more, while having experience in building and scaling developer communities. I've played around a little with Android Development, Design, Arduino and Open Source. I love to learn new things and always look for ways to contribute in any possible way.
